#Image To PDF  
In this project I have extracted the text from imaged book using **tesseract**.  
* First I have a imaged PDF(PDF with no selectable text).   
* Using *pdf2imge* I converted the PDF's pages to image(JPEG).   
* Then using *tesseract* I scanned the image extracted the text.  
* And using *fpdf* I converted the text into PDF.  

Finally I have the **book**( text is selectable).
